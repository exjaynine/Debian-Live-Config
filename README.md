# Debian-Live-Config
Custom tailored Debian Live ISO Configuration.

Ensure that in the bookworm directory, the config script within the subdirectory is made executable (chmod +x) and then in the directory above auto (bookworm) just type lb config and then sudo lb build.

This is a work in progress.
